## VISIONSPEED : SPEED DETECTION AND OBJECT TRACKING USING YOLOv8

## OVERVIEW ##

VisionSpeed is a project designed to detect vehicle speeds and track objects in real-time using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection technology. Leveraging computer vision techniques, this project aims to provide accurate and efficient monitoring of vehicle movement in traffic scenarios.

## KEY FEATURES ##
- Speed Detection: VisionSpeed utilizes YOLO to detect vehicles in a video feed and calculates their speeds as they traverse a designated area.
- Object Tracking: In addition to speed detection, the project employs object tracking techniques to monitor the movement of detected vehicles over time.
- Customization: The project allows for easy customization of detection parameters, such as line placement for speed measurement and configurable object classes for tracking.
- Visualization: Annotated frames and a video output provide visual feedback, highlighting detected vehicles and their corresponding speeds.

## EXPERIENCE VISION SPEED 
- Run the provided notebook (SpeedDetection.ipynb) in COLAB.
